# Smart Leave Management System - Hackathon Pitch

---

## The Problem

Traditional leave management systems operate in a vacuum—completely disconnected from the realities of team workload, deadline pressures, and project risk. Leave approvals are manual, subjective, and often fail to account for the downstream impact on team productivity and project delivery.

**The result?** Unbalanced workloads, missed deadlines, and frustrated teams.

---

## Our Solution

We built a **workload-aware leave management system** that transforms leave approvals from a gut-feeling decision into a data-driven process.

Our system evaluates every leave request against:
- **Active task load** — knowing exactly what each team member has on their plate
- **Deadline conflicts** — identifying when time-off creates critical bottlenecks
- **Impact scoring** — quantifying the risk level before any decision is made

Then, our intelligent rule-based engine makes informed approval decisions that protect both the employee and the team.

## Why This Matters

Every feature directly addresses a real pain point—no leave request gets approved in isolation anymore. Our system ensures that time off is balanced with team capacity, preventing burnout while maintaining project momentum.

**This isn't just leave management. It's smart workforce orchestration.**
